# 💻 Fixing ADB/Fastboot Driver Problems on Windows

Are ADB or Fastboot not recognizing your Android device on Windows? This often points to a **driver problem**. These drivers are essential for your PC to communicate with your phone when it's in regular Android mode (ADB) or bootloader/Fastboot mode.

## 🩺 Symptoms of Driver Problems

You likely have a driver problem if:

* Running `adb devices` or `fastboot devices` shows nothing, or `<waiting for device>`.
* In **Device Manager** (search `devmgmt.msc`), your phone appears as "Unknown device," "Android," or "Android Bootloader Interface" with a yellow exclamation mark (⚠️).

## 🚀 Fixing the ADB/Fastboot Driver Problems

Try these methods in order:

### Method 1: Use Universal ADB Drivers (Easiest First Try)

Universal drivers often resolve issues quickly.

1.  **Download:** Get a 15 Sec ADB driver installer, See [this](https://xdaforums.com/t/official-tool-windows-adb-fastboot-and-drivers-15-seconds-adb-installer-v1-4-3.2588979/)
2.  **Run Installer:** Follow the installer's prompts.
3.  **Reboot PC:** Restart your computer.
Your problem must be fixed!

### Method 2: Manually Update Driver via Device Manager

If the universal driver doesn't work, you can manually point Windows to the correct drivers.

1.  **Download Google USB Driver:** Download the [Google USB Driver](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb) and extract it to a folder (you'll find an `android_winusb.inf` file inside).
2.  **Connect Device:** Connect your phone to your PC (in ADB mode with USB Debugging on, or in Fastboot mode).
3.  **Open Device Manager:** Right-click the Start button and choose "Device Manager."
4.  **Locate Your Device:** Look for your phone. It might be listed under "Other devices" (as "Unknown device"), "Android Device," or "Android Bootloader Interface" (in Fastboot mode). It might have a yellow exclamation mark.
5.  **Update Driver:**
    * Right-click on your device entry.
    * Select **`Update driver`**.
    * Choose **`Browse my computer for driver software`**.
    * Click **`Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer`**.
    * Click **`Have Disk...`**.
    * Click **`Browse...`** and navigate to the `usb_driver` folder you extracted. Select the `android_winusb.inf` file.
    * Click `Open`, then `OK`.
    * Select "Android ADB Interface" or "Android Bootloader Interface" from the list and click `Next`.
    * If you see a warning about unsigned drivers, click "Install this driver software anyway."
    * **Tip:** If Windows blocks the driver installation due to signature issues, you might need to temporarily disable "Driver Signature Enforcement." To do this, go to `Settings` > `Update & Security` (or `System` > `Recovery` on Windows 11) > `Advanced startup` (or `Restart now` under Recovery options). After restart, navigate to `Troubleshoot` > `Advanced options` > `Startup Settings` > `Restart`. Then press `7` or `F7` to disable driver signature enforcement. Your PC will reboot. Now try this manual driver update method again.
6.  **Reboot PC:** Restart your computer after installation.
7.  **Test:** Reconnect your device and test with `adb devices` or `fastboot devices`.

If you're still having trouble after these steps, your specific device or Windows setup might have a unique quirk. Searching your device's XDA Developers forum or an online search for "[Your Phone Model] ADB drivers" can often provide device-specific solutions.
