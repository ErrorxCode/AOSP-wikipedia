## üì¶ Flashing & Installation
First of all know what kind of device you have (reffer [FAQ](/FAQs.md)), either A/B device or A-only device. A/B device has 2 slots (dynamic partitions) A and B and does not have seperate recovery partition.
**Modern devices (Android 10+) are coming with A/B slots**

If you have a older device that has a **seperate recovery partition**, then your device is A only device.

After that, reffer to [universal_flashing_guide](universal_flashing-instrutions.md)
